Identification Tables for Common Minerals in Thin Section
"These tables provide a concise summary of the properties of a range of common minerals. Within the tables, minerals are arranged by colour so as to"
"help with identification. If a mineral commonly has a range of colours, it will appear once for each colour."
"To identify an unknown mineral, start by answering the following questions:"
(1) What colour is the mineral?
(2) What is the relief of the mineral?
"(3) Do you think you are looking at an igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rock?"
"Go to the chart, and scan the properties. Within each colour group, minerals are arranged in order of increasing refractive index (which more or less"
"corresponds to relief). This should at once limit you to only a few minerals. By looking at the chart, see which properties might help you distinguish"
"between the possibilities. Then, look at the mineral again, and check these further details."
Notes:
"(i) Name: names listed here may be strict mineral names (e.g., andalusite), or group names (e.g., chlorite), or distinctive variety names (e.g., titanian augite). These tables contain a"
"personal selection of some of the more common minerals. Remember that there are nearly 4000 minerals, although 95% of these are rare or very rare. The minerals in here probably"
make up 95% of medium and coarse-grained rocks in the crust.
"(ii) IMS: this gives a simple assessment of whether the mineral is common in igneous (I), metamorphic (M) or sedimentary (S) rocks. These are not infallible guides - in particular"
"many igneous and metamorphic minerals can occur occasionally in sediments. Bear this in mind, even if minerals are not marked as being common in sediments."
"(iii) Colour in TS etc: the range of colours for each mineral is given, together with a description of any pleochroism. Note that these are colours seen in thin-section, not hand-"
specimen. The latter will always be much darker and more intense than thin section colours.
"(iv) RI: the total range of refractive index shown by the mineral with this coulour is shown: This covers any range due to compositional variation by solid solution, as well as the two"
or three refractive indices of anisotropic minerals.
"(v) Relief : is described verbally, followed by a sign indicating whether the relief is positive or negative (ie greater or less than the mounting medium of the thin-section - 1.54)."
"Minerals with refractive indices close to 1.54 have low relief, those with much higher or lower refractive indexes will have high relief."
(vi) Extinction: angles are only given where minerals usually show a linear feature such as a cleavage and/or long crystal faces. For plagioclase feldspars (stippled) the extinction
angles given are those determined by the Michel-Levy method (see a textbook for details).
"(vi) Int. Figure: this gives details of the interference figure. Any numbers given refer to the value of 2V (normally a range is given), followed by the optic sign. For uniaxial minerals"
"the word ""Uni"" is given, followed by the sign. Your course may or may not have covered interference figures. If not, ignore this section!"
"(vii) Birefr: Birefringence is described verbally, In some cases the maximum is given as a colour, in other cases you will need to cross-refer to an interference colour chart."
"(viii) Twinning etc.: a few notes about twinning, or other internal features of crystals may be given. If no twinning is mentioned, then the phenomenon is not common in thin section,"
but this does not mean that it NEVER occurs.
"(ix) Notes: general tips on appearance, occurrence and distinguishing features. May include indication of whether the mineral is length fast or slow - again a feature not covered in all"
courses - but a useful and easily-determined property.

Remember :the tables on previous pages give only a selection of the more common minerals. Brief properties of a few additional minerals are given below. You may
wish to cross-reference these to fuller descriptions in your favourite textbook.
Some additional colourless igneous minerals :
"leucite: (feldspathoid) moderate -ve relief; very low dark grey birefringence shows complex twinning, a bit like microcline. Phenocrysts in ultra-potassic lavas. Once seen never"
forgotten.
sodalite: (feldspathoid) low-mod -ve relief. Isotropic. Euhedral xls or irreg. grains in Na-rich syenites and trachytes. Often blue in hand specimens.
cancrinite: (feldspathoid) low-mod -ve relief. Irregular or slighly elongate grains with nepheline. Mod. Birefr: up to mid II order - bright for such an inconspicuous colourless
mineral. Common minor phase in nepheline syenites.
"sanidine: (feldspar) low -ve relief. Xls usually clear. Birefr. low: up to pale grey. Extinction parallel to cleavage, but not to long xl sides. 2V low: 0-12 -ve. Carlsbad twins"
common. Usually phenocrysts in trachytes and rhyolites.
anorthoclase: (feldspar) low -ve relief. Birefr. Low: up to pale grey. 2V 50 -ve (only feldspar like this); may show very fine grained cross-hatched twinning (like microcline).
Phenocrysts in alkaline lavas etc.
"melilite: mod +ve relief. Lath-like xls (like plagioclase shape), often with indented sides. Low birefr., often anomalous blue. Parallel extinction. Uniaxial -ve. In Si-deficient"
"igneous rocks, with nepheline, augite, olivine, leucite, perovskite"
"phlogopite: (mica) moderate +ve relief; platy, perfect cleavage; colourless to pale brown, slightly pleochroic. III order birefringence. Parallel extinction. Mostly in meta"
"limestones, plus K-rich ultrabasic igneous rocks."
wollastonite: mod-high +ve relief. Columnar or fibrous aggregates. Birefr up to I order orange. Extinction parallel (cf tremolite). Rare in igneous rocks: in carbonatites and
some ijolites.
"topaz: mod-high +ve relief. Usually anhedral in TS. Birefr like quartz, but 2V 50. 1 perfect cleavage. Granites and rhyolites, with tourmaline, fluorite and muscovite."
"pigeonite: (clinopyroxene) mod-high +ve relief. Stout prismatic xls in tholeiitic basalts and andesites, also irregular grains in gabbros and dolerites. May invert to opx host with"
cpx lamellae or blebs. Birefr. mod: up to II order. 2V low: 0-40 (distinctive). Often twinned. Extinction angle 20-40 to cleavage.
"monazite: high +ve relief. Usually small or tiny stout prismatic xls looking like titanite. Birefr. Up to IV order, but may be very low due to radiation damage. Dispersion r < v"
on isogyres (cf titanite r > v). In granites and carbonatites.
Some additional colourless metamorphic minerals :
scapolite: low-mod +ve relief. Columnar xls or poikilitic plates. Birefr. up to mid II order (high for an inconspicuous mineral). Extinction parallel to xls or cleavage. Uniaxial -
ve. Metabasites and marbles.
"talc: low-mod +ve relief. Looks like mica - perfect cleavage. High birefr. up to III order. Hard to tell from muscovite, but assocd with Mg rich minerals, and soapy in hand"
specimen.
"phlogopite: (mica) moderate +ve relief; platy, perfect cleavage; colourless to pale brown, slightly pleochroic. III order birefringence. Parallel extinction. Mostly in meta"
"limestones, plus K-rich ultrabasic igneous rocks."
"jadeite: (clinopyroxene) mod-high +ve. Granular or fibrous aggregates, or rough grains. Good xls very rare. Birefr, mod: up to mid II order. Extinction up to 44 to cleavage. 2V"
70 +ve. In high-pressure (blueschist/eclogite facies) meta rocks.
"lawsonite: Relief mod + ve. Often as late euhedral rhomb-shaped or rectangular porphyroblasts, often inlcusion rich, in blueschists. May resemble colourless epidote, bit lower"
birefringence: up to mid II order.
zoisite: (epidote group) relief high +ve. Elongate grains or aggregates. 1 cleavage along length. Parallel extinction. Normally shows deep blue anomalous interference colour. In
metabasites and metacalcareous rocks.
clinozoisite: (epidote group) relief high +ve. Elongate grains or aggregates. 1 cleavage along length. Parallel extinction. Birefringence anomalous: blue-grey and greenish
"yellow (hard to describe, but easy to remember once seen). Mostly in metabasites and metacalcareous rocks."

"Birefr. weak, but often up to low II order due to extra thickness of ultra-hard corundum xls. Parallel extinction in long xls. Twinning common. Uniaxial -ve. In hornfelses, high"
grade pelites and syenitic gneisses.
